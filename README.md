We made a clicker game based around the idea of infecting different population sizes. As the game progresses different perks become available based on your point total and as you score reaches the population markers, the goal score then increases. The end goal is to infect the US population. After logging a new game state is created or your last data from your save is loaded. Your score, perks and progress is all stored locally. Pressing save will update the database entry that corresponds to your account.
