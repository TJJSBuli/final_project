We made a clicker game based around the idea of infecting different population sizes. As the game progresses different perks become available based on your point total and as you score reaches the population markers, the goal score then increases. The end goal is to infect the US population. After logging a new game state is created or your last data from your save is loaded. Your score, perks and progress is all stored locally. Pressing save will update the database entry that corresponds to your account.

Instructions: We user the login: user1 pass1 for testing but you should be able to make a new account

Technologies: We used JS, HTML and CSS as well we Handlebars and mongoDB

The main issue we had was figuring out which way we wanted to update and maintain the gamestate. 

Tristan primarily worked on the front end while James and Andrew focused on the back end.
